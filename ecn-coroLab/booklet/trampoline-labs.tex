\section{Foreword}

It is assumed that you have a basic knowledge of the command line.
If it is not the case, make sure to have the first configuration steps checked
by a member of the teaching team before to proceed with the labs.

\begin{framed}
Do not copy the commands from the PDF file, the characters you get may not have the correct code and the shell will not understand them.
\end{framed}

When typing shell commands, remember that spaces are important because they separate the command and its arguments. In this document, spaces in commands are represented by a white rectangle like in the following command (it is an example, do not type it):

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{.25\textwidth}
\unixcl{cd\blanc{}trampoline}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.7\textwidth}
sets the \texttt{trampoline} directory as current directory. This assumes the \texttt{trampoline} directory is a subdirectory of the current one.
\end{minipage}

\section{Setting up the environment}

The tools that we will use have already been installed on the machine:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Trampoline RTOS and the \texttt{goil} configuration generator;

  \item \texttt{arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain} including among other tools a c
    compiler and a c debugger;

  \item \texttt{stlink}, a set of tools to interact with the STM32F303 microcontroller.
\end{itemize}


In order to be able to use the tools, you have to define the configuration of your development environment.
First, you have to inform the system of the location of the tools.
This is done by setting the \texttt{PATH} environment variable in your \texttt{.profile} file.
\namedtodo[JLB]{Update path to reflect new locations}It can be done with the following commands:

\unixcl{echo\blanc{}"export\blanc{}PATH=/Volumes/PRETS/trampoline/goil/makefile-macosx:\$PATH" \blanc{}>>\blanc{}\normaltilde/.profile}


\unixcl{echo\blanc{}"export \blanc{}PATH=/Volumes/PRETS/gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2018-q4-major/bin:\$PATH"\blanc{}>>\blanc{}\normaltilde/.profile}

To get the \normaltilde~character on french apple keyboard, you have to use Alt+n.

It is assumed that the location of the\texttt{stlink} tools are already in the PATH.
If it is not the case, update your \texttt{.profile}.

The \texttt{.profile} file is parsed by the shell when it starts. To force your current shell instance to read the file, use the following command:

\unixcl{source\blanc{}\normaltilde/.profile}

This will enable the configuration in the terminal where you typed the command.
In order to have the configuration active in all terminals, you have to log out and then log in the system.

Now, check that \texttt{goil} is working.
The command \unixcl{goil\blanc{}--version} should print:

\medskip

\begin{shaded*}
\scriptsize
\vspace{-1.7mm}
\begin{verbatim}
goil : 3.1.9, build with GALGAS 3.3.11
No warning, no error.
\end{verbatim}
\end{shaded*}

Then check that \texttt{gcc-arm} is also working.
The command \unixcl{arm-none-eabi-gcc\blanc{}--version} should print:

\medskip

\begin{shaded*}
\scriptsize
\vspace{-1.7mm}
\begin{verbatim}
arm-none-eabi-gcc (GNU Tools for Arm Embedded Processors 8-2018-q4-major) 8.2.1 20181213 [...]
Copyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
\end{verbatim}
\end{shaded*}

Last, check that \texttt{stlink} tools are available with the following command: \unixcl{st-info\blanc{}--version}.
The output should be:

\medskip

\begin{shaded*}
\scriptsize
\vspace{-1.7mm}
\begin{verbatim}
v1.3.0
\end{verbatim}
\end{shaded*}

You are now ready to compile and load your first application on the board. But first, let's take a quick look at the board.

\chapter{The board}

\section{Overview}

You already know the board since it is the same that is used for the labs of the MICRO course.
It is built around a STM32F303 microcontroller unit (MCU) that has an ARM Cortex-M4 computing core.
It is a 32 bits micro-controller running at 64MHz.
It embeds 65kB of flash memory to store the program and the constant data and 12kB of SRAM to store the variables.

Among the peripherals present on the board, we will use:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the reset button;
    \item the LCD screen;
    \item the I/O extender that is used to connect:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item on port A, 8 leds;
        \item on port B, 4 push buttons and 4 switches.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Communication between the MCU and both the LCD and the I/O multiplexer uses the SPI interface of the MCU.
Thus to ensure integrity of transactions, the software design must enforce that transactions are atomic with regards to each others.

The board power is supplied by USB.
Connect a USB  port to the MCU USB plug and the board switches on.

\section{The \texttt{coro_utils} functions}
\label{sec:coroutils}

\namedtodo[MB]{Update section to reflect integration of functions through
  \texttt{setupBoard}.}{A set of functions} are provided to use the LCD, the I/O extender, and one of the embedded timer.
The source code of these functions is provided in the \texttt{coro_utils.cpp} file.
Some of them are documented below.

\begin{description}
    \item[void setupIOExtender()] sets up the IO extender. This function has to be called once, before to use the functions of the IO Extender driver (see below).
    \item[void setupDisplay()] sets up the display. This function has to be called once, before to use the printing functions.
    \item[void eraseDisplay()] erases the display.
    \item[void println_string(\textit{const char * str})] prints \textit{str} on the TFT and goes to next line.
    \item[void println_uint(\textit{uint32_t u})] prints \textit{u} on the TFT and goes to next line.
    \item[void println_int(\textit{int32_t u})] prints \textit{i} on the TFT and goes to next line.
    \item[void setupTimer()] sets up timer TIM6 with a 1$\mu$s tick. This function has to be called once, before to use the functions related to the timer.
    \item[void resetTimer()] resets TIM6 value to 0.
    \item[uint32_t getTimerValue()] returns TIM6 current value.
\end{description}


\section{The IO extender driver}

The IO extender drivers implements a set of functions to change the states of LEDs and poll the state of buttons.
Notice that the programming of IO pins in input or output is done in the \textit{setupIOExtender} function.

The driver is provided by the class \textit{mcp23s17}.
Users should not create instance of this class as a singleton instance named \textit{ioExt} is created at compile time.

Among the funciton provided by the driver, we will use:

\begin{description}
    \item[void digitalWrite(\textit{port p}, \textit{uint8\_t bitNum, bool value})] sets the value of bit \textit{bitNum} (in the range 0 to 7) of port \textit{p} (either \texttt{mcp23s17::PORTA} or \texttt{mcp23s17::PORTB}) to value \textit{value} (0 or 1).

    \item[uint8\_t digitalRead(\textit{port p}, \textit{uint8\_t bitNum})] returns the value of bit \textit{bitNum} (in the range 0 to 7) of port \textit{p} (either \texttt{mcp23s17::PORTA} or \texttt{mcp23s17::PORTB}).

    \item[void digitalToggle(\textit{port p}, \textit{uint8\_t bitNum})] toggles the value of bit \textit{bitNum} (in the range 0 to 7) of port \textit{p} (either \texttt{mcp23s17::PORTA} or \texttt{mcp23s17::PORTB}).

    \item[void setBits(\textit{port p}, \textit{uint8\_t bitField})] sets the value of bits of port \textit{p} contained in \textit{bitField} to HIGH.

    \item[void clearBits(\textit{port p}, \textit{uint8\_t bitField})] sets the value of bits of port \textit{p} contained in \textit{bitField} to LOW.

    \item[void writeBits(\textit{port p}, \textit{uint8\_t val})] overwrites values of bits of \textit{p} with \textit{val}.

    \item[uint8_t readBits(\textit{port p})] returns the values of bits of \textit{p}.
\end{description}

As an illustration, the following code turn on LED 0 and toggles LED 1.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
TASK(t_LED0ON_LED1TOGGLE)
{
    ioExt.digitalWrite(mcp23s17::PORTA, 0, 1);
    ioExt.digitalToggle(mcp23s17::PORTA, 1);
    TerminateTask();
}
\end{lstlisting}


And the following example reads switch button {0} to start Trampoline in a specific appmode.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int main()
{
    if (ioExt.digitalRead(mcp23s17::PORTB, 0) == 0)
    {
      /* Start Trampoline in the testAppmode appmode */
      StartOS(testAppmode);
    }
    else                       /* otherwise */
    {
      /* Start Trampoline in the default appmode */
      StartOS(OSDEFAULTAPPMODE);
    }
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}


\chapter{Lab 1 -- Understanding fixed priority scheduling}

\section{Goal}

The goal of this lab is to become familiar with the development
process of application using Trampoline RTOS, and to understand how fixed priority scheduling works.
We will also see Events.

Trampoline includes an OIL compiler.
It reads a static description of the objects of the application (tasks,
ISRs, events, resources, etc.) and generates the corresponding OS data structures.
In addition to the OIL description, the developer must of course provide the C
source code of the body of tasks and ISRs.


\section{Starting point}

Go into the lab1 directory. There are 2 files:

\begin{description}
    \item[lab1.oil] a minimal OIL description.
    \item[lab1.cpp] a minimal source code.
\end{description}

Edit the lab1.oil file and update the \texttt{TRAMPOLINE\_BASE\_PATH} attribute
in function of your configuration: it should point to the directory where Trampoline is installed.

%You should also modify the \texttt{LDFLAGS} lines describing the location of the libraries used by the cross compiler. Set the first line to:

%{\footnotesize
%\begin{verbatim}
%-L/usr/local/tp_treel_imta/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2018-q2-update/arm-none-eabi/lib/thumb/v7e-m
%\end{verbatim}}

%and the second one to:

%{\footnotesize
%\begin{verbatim}
%-L/usr/local/tp_treel_imta/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2018-q2-update/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/7.3.1/thumb/v7e-m
%\end{verbatim}}


lab1 is a very simple application with only 1 task named \texttt{task1}. It
starts automatically (\texttt{AUTOSTART = TRUE \{ ... \}} in the OIL file) and
turns on LED A0.

To compile this application, go into the lab1 directory and type (on a single line):

%\unixcl{\parbox{230\unitlength}{export\blanc{}PATH=\$PATH\textbackslash\\
%:\normaltilde/trampoline/goil/makefile-macosx\textbackslash\\
%:\normaltilde/Tools/gcc-arm/gcc-arm-none-eabi/bin\textbackslash\\
%:\normaltilde/Tools/bin}}

\namedtodo[JLB]{update path}
\unixcl{\parbox{\linewidth}{%
        goil\blanc{}--target=cortex/armv7em/stm32f303/coroLabBoard\blanc{}\\%\textbackslash\\
--templates=/path/to/trampoline/goil/templates\blanc{}lab1.oil}}

The \texttt{--target} option is used to define the target system (here we generate the OS level data structures of Trampoline for a \texttt{cortex} core with the \texttt{armv7em} instruction set, a \texttt{stm32f303} micro-controller and the board is the \texttt{coroLabBoard}).
The \texttt{--templates} option indicates where to find the template files used to generate the configuration of the kernel.

Alongside the C files of the kernel configuration, Goil also generates a build script for the application (files \texttt{make.py} and \texttt{build.py}).

If you change something in the OIL file or in your source code file, you do not need to re-run Goil because the build script should run it when needed.

Continue the build process by typing:

\unixcl{./make.py}

The application and Trampoline OS are compiled and linked together.
The target file is named \texttt{lab1\_elf}.

To upload the application, check that the board is connected to the computer, then type:

\unixcl{./make.py\blanc{}burn}

The following message is displayed (some lines have been truncated to fit on the page):

\begin{shaded*}
\scriptsize
\vspace{-1.7mm}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
\end{shaded*}

The program starts and LED A0 should be on.

%\subsection{A word about memory sections}

%AUTOSAR defines a way to put objects (constants, variables and functions) in memory sections in a portable way\footnote{memory section declaration is not part of the C standard}. For that, a set of macro are used along with a generated file: MemMap.h. Functions should be declared with the \lstinline{FUNC} macro, variables with the \lstinline{VAR} macro, constants with the \lstinline{CONST} macro and pointers to variables, pointers to constant, constant pointers to variable and constant pointers to constant with \lstinline{P2VAR}, \lstinline{P2CONST}, \lstinline{CONSTP2VAR} and \lstinline{CONSTP2CONST} respectively. Sections are opened and closed with a macro definition and the inclusion of the \lstinline{tpl_memmap.h} file. For instance:

%\begin{lstlisting}
%#define APP_Task_my_periodic_task_START_SEC_VAR_32BIT
%#include "tpl_memmap.h"
%VAR(int, AUTOMATIC) period;
%VAR(int, AUTOMATIC) occurence;
%#define APP_Task_my_periodic_task_STOP_SEC_VAR_32BIT
%#include "tpl_memmap.h"
%\end{lstlisting}

%defines variables \lstinline{period} and \lstinline{occurence} in the variables section of task \lstinline{my_periodic_task}.

%\begin{lstlisting}
%#define APP_Task_my_periodic_task_START_SEC_CODE
%#include "tpl_memmap.h"
%TASK(my_periodic_task)
%{
  %...
  %TerminateTask();
%}
%#define APP_Task_my_periodic_task_STOP_SEC_CODE
%#include "tpl_memmap.h"
%\end{lstlisting}

%defines the task \lstinline{my_periodic_task} in the code section of task \lstinline{my_periodic_task}. \lstinline{goil} generates the sections for tasks according to the description.


\section{OS system calls and tasks}

For each question, you should create a copy of the lab1 directory and change its name to lab1q1, lab1q2, \ldots

\subsection{Task activation and scheduling}

The \texttt{ActivateTask()} system call allows to activate a task of the application.

\begin{ex}
    Add two tasks in the system: \texttt{task2} and \texttt{task3}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item add the declaration of both tasks in the OIL file; \texttt{task2} should have priority 1 and its AUTOSTART attribute should be set to FALSE; \texttt{task3} should have priority 8 and its AUTOSTART attribute should be set to FALSE;
        \item in the cpp file, you should:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item declare each tasks with the DeclareTask keyword,
                \item provide the body of each tasks:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item task \texttt{task2} turns on LED A2 and turns off LED A3;
                        \item task \texttt{task3} turns on LED A3 and turns off LED A2;
                    \end{itemize}
                \item and, lastly, modify task \texttt{task1} so that is activates \texttt{task2} and \texttt{task3} (in this order).
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    Before to execute the resulting application, draw a schedule and determine the final state of LEDS.
    Your diagram must clearly show activation, execution and termination of each job using symbols used in the course.
    Then execute the application and check the correctness of your diagram.
\end{ex}

\subsubsection{Using the debugger to follow the scheduling}
\namedtodo[SF]{add text on gdb, add \texttt{init.gdb}
  in code.}{TODO}

\begin{ex}
  Run the application step by step with the debugger and follow the scheduling.
  Identify precisely the preemption point in the code of each tasks.
\end{ex}


\subsubsection{Measuring execution times with a timer}

\namedtodo[SF]{add text on timer API + text on where to use functions}{TODO}

\begin{ex}
    Build an application to measure the execution time of \texttt{ActivateTask} in the following cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item fully preemptive scheduling, activation of a higher priority task.
        \item fully preemptive scheduling, activation of a lower priority task.
        \item fully non preemptive scheduling, activation of a higher priority task.
        \item fully non preemptive scheduling, activation of a lower priority task.
    \end{itemize}

    Explain how to use the timer functions for each case and explain the results.
\end{ex}

\subsection{Task chaining}

The \texttt{ChainTask()} system call allows to chain the execution of a task: the calling job terminates and a new job of the target task is created.

\begin{ex}
    Starting from the application of question~1, replace the call to \texttt{TerminateTask} by a \texttt{ChainTask(task3)} at the end of task a task.
    Update task \texttt{task3} so that it prints something each time it is executed.
    Draw a schedule of the new system.
    Then execute the application to check the correctness of your diagram.
    Comment on the differences with the previous application.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    Chain to \texttt{task2} instead of \texttt{task3}.
    Update task \texttt{task2} so that it prints something each time it is executed.
    Draw a schedule of the new system.
    Then execute the application to check the correctness of your diagram.
    Comment on the differences with the previous application.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    Test the error code returned by ChainTask.
    Modify the OIL file so that ChainTask returns \texttt{E\_OK}.
    Draw a schedule of the new system.
    Then execute the application to check the correctness of your diagram.
    Comment on the differences with the previous application.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    Build an application to measure the execution time of \texttt{ChainTask} in the following cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item fully preemptive scheduling, activation of a higher priority task.
        \item fully preemptive scheduling, activation of a lower priority task.
        \item fully non preemptive scheduling, activation of a higher priority task.
        \item fully non preemptive scheduling, activation of a lower priority task.
    \end{itemize}

    Explain how to use the timer functions for each case and explain the results.
\end{ex}

\section{Extended tasks and synchronization using events}

\textcolor{red}{\emph{For the following exercises, you should use full preemptive scheduling mode.}}

Unlike a basic task, an extended task may wait for an event.
In terms of scheduling, a job is activated when a task is activated or when it leaves the waiting state.

Before to proceed with the following questions, consult the slides of the course to become familiar with events in Trampoline.

%In the OIL file, set the priority of \texttt{task_0} to 8 and add two events \texttt{evt_0} and \texttt{evt_1}. \texttt{evt_0} is used by \texttt{task_0} and \texttt{evt_1} is used by \texttt{task_1}. \texttt{a_task} activates \texttt{task_0} and \texttt{task_1} then sets \texttt{evt_0} and \texttt{evt_1} and terminates. \texttt{task_0} and \texttt{task_1} wait for their event, clear it and terminate.

\begin{ex}
     Based on the application of Question~1, build an application with the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item set priority of \texttt{task1} to 8;
    \item add two events, \texttt{evt\_1} and \texttt{evt\_2}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{evt\_1} is set by task \texttt{task0} to task \texttt{task1}.
            \item \texttt{evt\_2} is set by task \texttt{task0} to task \texttt{task2}.
        \end{itemize}
    \item modify the code of the tasks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item task \texttt{task0} activates \texttt{task1} and \texttt{task2} then sets \texttt{evt\_1} and \texttt{evt\_2} before to terminate.
            \item tasks \texttt{task1} and \texttt{task2} wait for their event, clear it, and terminate.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Draw a schedule of the new system.
Then execute the application to check the correctness of your diagram (before to run the application, add outputs in the code of the task, for instance writes to the LCD or LEDs to ease the correctness checking).

\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    Build an application to measure the execution time of \texttt{SetEvent} in the following cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item fully preemptive scheduling, setting an event to a higher priority tasks that is not waiting for the event.
        \item fully preemptive scheduling, setting an event to a higher priority tasks that is waiting for the event.
        \item fully preemptive scheduling, setting an event to a lower priority tasks that is not waiting for the event.
        \item fully preemptive scheduling, setting an event to a lower priority tasks that is waiting for the event.
    \end{itemize}

    Explain how to use the timer functions for each case and explain the results.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Program an application conforming to the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item it is composed of two tasks: \texttt{server} priority 2, \texttt{t1} priority 1.
    \item \texttt{server} is an infinite loop that activates \texttt{t1} and waits for event \texttt{evt\_1}.
    \item \texttt{t1} prints ``I am t1'' and sets \texttt{evt\_1} of \texttt{server}.
\end{itemize}

Before to run the application, draw a schedule of the execution. Add outputs in the bodies of the task (for instance writes to the LCD or the LEDs) to verify your schedule.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Extend the previous application by adding 2 tasks: \texttt{t2} and \texttt{t3} (priority 1 for both) and 2 events \texttt{evt\_2} and \texttt{evt\_3}. \texttt{server} activates \texttt{t1}, \texttt{t2} and \texttt{t3} and waits for one of the events. When one of the events is set, \texttt{server} activates the corresponding task again.

Before to run the application, draw a schedule of the execution. Add outputs in the bodies of the task (for instance writes to the LCD or the LEDs) to verify your schedule.
\end{ex}

\chapter{Lab 2 -- Periodic tasks and Alarms}

\section{Goal}

Real-Time systems are reactive systems which have to do processing as a result of events. You have seen in Lab \#1 how to start processing as a result of an internal event of the system: by activating a task (\texttt{ActivateTask} and \texttt{ChainTask} services) or by setting an event (\texttt{SetEvent} service). In this lab, you will trigger processing as a result of time elapsing (expiration of an Alarm). This lab uses the following concepts: alarm and counter. On the lab board, the Systick timer is used as interrupt source for alarms. The interrupt is sent every 1ms.

\section{First application}

This application implements a periodic task that reads switch button B0 of the board every 100ms.
When switch B0 is open, A3 is turned off.
When button B0 is closed, A3 is turned on.

\begin{ex}
    The \texttt{updateStateOfB0} function implements a small state machine to convert the state of the switch button to states and events.
    Draw this state machine.
    Draw a schedule of the application (the execution of the interrupt service routine associated with the Systick will not be represented; it will be assumed to be negligible).
    Your diagram should show the instants where the state of the switch changes as well as the state of A3.
    Build and execute the application to verify your diagram.
\end{ex}

Modify the application: when B0 is closed, a processing is triggered.
This processing is performed by activating a job of task \texttt{t_process} (priority 3) that, on odd executions, turns on LEDS A4 to A8 and on even executions turns them off.
\begin{ex}
Draw a schedule of the application.
Your diagram should show the physical state of the switch as well as the state of the LEDs (associate numbers with the different state and use these numbers in your diagram).
Build and execute the application to verify your diagram.
\end{ex}


\section{Second application}

The second application will use 2 periodic tasks: \texttt{t1} (priority 2, period 1s) and \texttt{t2} (priority 1, period 1.5s). t1 toggles LED A3 each time it executes and t2 toggles LED A4.

\begin{ex}
    Draw a schedule of the application that show the 20 first states of the LEDs.
    What is the global period of the system?
\end{ex}

The application needs a counter and 2 alarms. Program, build, and run the application.

\section{Third application}

In the third application, alarms, counters, and polling of the switch buttons are mixed.
This application is a system with 2 switches.
After startup, the system is waiting.
When the first switch is closed, the system starts a {\it function}\footnote{Here we mean a function of the application, not a function of the C language.} F that is implemented using a periodic task (period = 1s).
To ``see'' F, uses a blinking LED.
When the first switch is opened, function F is stopped.
When the second switch is closed, the system is shutdown as quickly as possible (ie ShutdownOS\footnote{The ShutdownOS service shutdowns the operating system. All tasks and alarms are stopped. ShutdownOS takes a StatusType argument to specify the kind or error which occurred. In our case use E\_OK as argument.} is called).

\begin{ex}
    Explain the design of the application: provide the list and configuration of tasks and alarms.
    Draw schedules showing different executions.
    Build and execute the application to verify your diagrams.
\end{ex}

Requirements change. Now function F implementation needs an Init code
(runs once when F is started) and a Final code (runs once when F is stopped) as shown in the following diagram:

\begin{center}
    \resizebox{14cm}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[step=.5cm,gray!20,very thin] (-0.5, -0.5) grid (16.5,1.5);
\draw [->] (-0.5,0) -- (16,0);
\node [yshift=-3mm] at (16,0) {time};
\draw (0,0) rectangle (1.2,1);
\node at (0.6,0.5) {Init};
\draw (1.2,0) rectangle (2.7,1);
\node at (1.95,0.5) {Body};
\draw (4,0) rectangle (5.5,1);
\node at (4.75,0.5) {Body};
\draw (8,0) rectangle (9.5,1);
\node at (8.75,0.5) {Body};
\foreach \x in {0, 4}
  \draw [xshift=\x cm,thick,<->] (0,-0.5) -- (4,-0.5);
\draw [xshift=8 cm,thick,<-(] (0,-0.5) -- (3,-0.5);
\draw [xshift=11cm] (0,0) rectangle (1.2,1);
\node [xshift=11cm] at (0.6,0.5) {Final};
\node [rectangle callout, fill=green!50, callout absolute pointer={(0,1)}] at (-1,2) {Start request};
\node [rectangle callout, fill=red!50, callout absolute pointer={(11,1)}] at (12,2) {Stop request};
\end{tikzpicture}
} %% resizebox
\end{center}


\begin{ex}
    Modify the application to take the new requirements into account.
    Your implementation will use only basic tasks.
    Each phase of F (Init, Body, and Final) is executed in a different task.
    Explain the design of the application: provide the list and configuration of tasks and alarms.
    Draw schedules showing different execution scenarii.
    Build and execute the application to verify your diagrams.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    Same question as above, but your implementation will use an extended task to control the execution of Init, F, and Stop.
\end{ex}

\section{Fourth application}

In this part, you will implement a watchdog. It is a mechanism that allows to stop a processing or a waiting period once a delay has elapsed.

In your application, each time B0 is closed, B3 must be pressed within 4 seconds. In this case, you print the time between the two occurrences. Otherwise, an error message is displayed. If B0 is closed more than once are within 5 seconds from the first time, these events are ignored.

\begin{ex}
    Specify this behaviour with a state machine.
    What is happening if the timeout occurs just after B3 has been closed but before the waiting task got the event?
    Design and program a solution that handles this situation correctly.
    Draw a schedule of the behaviour of your application in such a scenario (this schedule should show the state of the alarms).
\end{ex}

\section{Fifth application}

Program a chase\footnote{chenillard in French} with a 0.5s period. To do so, use 8 periodic tasks. Each periodic task manages a LED. The chase effect is done by using alarms with a time shift between them.

When B0 is closed, the chase starts, when it is opened, it is reset.
When B3 is closed, the chase stops until B3 is opened.
When B2 is closed, the chase direction changes (even if it is stopped).

\begin{ex}
    Specify the high level behaviour with a state machine.
    Design and program the application.
    Explain your design.
\end{ex}

\chapter{Lab 3 -- Shared object access protection}

To show resources usage, we will use a bad program that allows to corrupt a shared global variable which is not protected against concurrent writes. This has been presented in the course. This lab will show different ways to prevent this wrong behavior by using resources (standard and internal) or other solutions (preemption and priority).

To ensure that the compiler does not hide our bug, update the value of the \texttt{CFLAGS} key in the OIL file: replace option \texttt{-Os} by \texttt{-O0} to turn off all optimizations.

\section{Application requirements}

The diagram of figure~\ref{fig:appdiag} describes the application.
It is composed of 3 tasks that share 2 global variables {\bf declared with the volatile keyword}: \texttt{val} and \texttt{activationCount}:
\begin{itemize}
\item a background task called \texttt{bgTask}, activated at startup. In an infinite loop it increments then decrements the global variable \texttt{val}. This task has priority 1.
\item a periodic task called \texttt{periodicTask} that activates a job every 50ms. This periodic task increments the global variable \texttt{activationCount}. If \texttt{activationCount} is odd, \texttt{val} is incremented, otherwise it is decremented. This task has priority 10.
\item a periodic task \texttt{displayTask} that runs every 2 second and prints \texttt{val} on the LCD. This task has priority 2.
\end{itemize}

    Design, program, and run the application.

    Comment.
\end{ex}


%Compile again your application but add a \unixcl{CFLAGS = "-O3"} in the OIL file. This flag
%makes the C compiler optimize the assembly code.

%\begin{ex}
%Is it the same behavior as in previous question? Why?
%\end{ex}



\section{Global variable protection}

%Remove the \unixcl{CFLAGS = "-O3"} from the OIL file. As shown in the course, we must protect the access to the global variable.

Update the OIL file and the C program to protect the access to the global variable \texttt{val}. Use a resource to do it.

The resource priority is automatically computed by goil according to the priorities of the tasks which use it.

The OIL compiler generates many files in the directory bearing the same name as the oil file (without the .oil suffix). Among them 3 are of interest for this lab:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{tpl_app_define.h}
\item \texttt{tpl_app_config.h}
\item \texttt{tpl_app_config.c}
\end{itemize}

The file \texttt{tpl_app_config.c} contains the tasks descriptors among other data structures. These structures are commented.

\begin{ex} ~
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Recall the computation rule of the ceiling priority of a resource with the immediate ceiling protocol.
            According to this rule, what should be the ceiling priority of the resource?
        \item
            Find the actual ceiling priority in \texttt{tpl_app_config.c}. Is it the expected value? If not, is it a problem?
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}

%To observe the impact of the priority ceiling protocol, use the following function to observe the priority of the jobs during their execution.

%\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
%void displayIdAndCurrentPriority()
%{
  %TaskType id;
  %GetTaskID(&id);
  %if (id >= 0)
  %{
    %tpl_priority prio = (tpl_dyn_proc_table[id]->priority) >> PRIORITY_SHIFT;
    %lcd.print("Id=");
    %lcd.print(id);
    %lcd.print(", Prio=");
    %lcd.print(prio);
  %}
%}
%\end{lstlisting}

%And you have to add the following line at start of your C file:

%\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
 %#include "tpl_os_task_kernel.h"
%\end{lstlisting}


\section{Protection with an internal resource}

An internal resource is automatically taken when the job gets the CPU, and released when it terminates. Replace the standard resource by an internal resource in the OIL file. Remove the \texttt{GetResource} and \texttt{ReleaseResource} in the C file.

\begin{ex}~
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            What happens? Why?
        \item
            How to solve the problem? Draw a schedule of a correct implementation of the system. Program this solution.
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}


\section{Protection using a single priority level}

\begin{ex}
Modify the OIL file: remove the resource and set the priorities so that all tasks share the same priority. Draw a schedule of the system.
\end{ex}

\section{Protection using fully non preemptive scheduling mode}

\begin{ex}
Modify the OIL file: all tasks are now non preemptive. Draw a schedule of the system.
\end{ex}


\section{Upgrading the coro\_utils function}

\begin{ex}
    As explained in section~\ref{sec:coroutils}, both the screen and the IO expander use the SPI interface of the MCU. Thus, to ensure coherency of the transactions, we have avoided using both devices in the same application. Upgrade the current implementations of the functions to solve this problem and design an application that shows the effectiveness of your solution.
\end{ex}

\chapter{Lab4\\Internal communication}

\section{Overview}

Internal messaging may be used as an easy to use replacement for shared variables. Messaging allows to send data between tasks. This lab will show the different ways to communicate in OSEK.

Design a first simple application with 2 communicating tasks.
The OIL file declare 2 tasks: \texttt{sender} and \texttt{receiver} and 2 messages: \texttt{outMessage} and \texttt{inMessage}. \texttt{inMessage} is connected to \texttt{outMessage}. Task \texttt{sender} uses \texttt{outMessage} and task \texttt{receiver} uses \texttt{inMessage}.

Task \texttt{sender} is activated every second by the mean of an alarm and sends data to \texttt{outMessage}.
Send for instance the number of activation of task \texttt{sender}.
When the data is received in \texttt{inMessage}, the notification mechanism activates task \texttt{receiver}.
\texttt{receiver} reads the data from \texttt{inMessage} and prints the value.

Notice that message identifiers must be declared before to be used in the source file with \texttt{DeclareMessage}.

\section{Message broadcasting}

OSEK messaging supports \emph{many-to-many} communication. This is done by having more than one receiving messages connected to the same sending message.
\begin{ex}
Add 2 other receiving messages connected to \texttt{outMessage}. The first message activates the task \texttt{Emergency} (add the corresponding task), the second message sets an event to task \texttt{NormalOperation} (add the corresponding extended tasks too). Write the C code of the tasks you added. The first one receives the message and prints the value; the second one waits for the event in an infinite loop, receives the message and prints the value. Check the application works as expected.
\end{ex}

\section{Filtering}

\begin{ex}
Add a filter to activate task \texttt{receiver} upon the 4th message and then every 3 values (ie 4th, 7th, 11st and so on).
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    Modify task \texttt{sender} to send  pseudo-random values ranging from 0 to 100 (you can use for instance xorshift32 as described here:\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift}) and then a modulus.
    Using filtering, set the event to task \texttt{NormalOperation} only if the value is within the range $[20,60]$; activate task \texttt{Emergency} only if the value is not within the range.
\end{ex}

\section{Queued messages}


\begin{ex}
    Restarting with the Messaging application, modify the \texttt{inMessage} to make it a queued message with a size of 4 data items and remove the notification. Add an alarm to activate task receiver every 4 seconds. Check the return value of \texttt{ReceiveMessage} and verify that no error occurred (queue under- or over-flow). If errors occur, correct the application.
\end{ex}



%%\chapter{Lab4\\Driving servos}

%%The goal of this lab is to build a small application to drive servomotors. Get the lab4 package from \url{http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/~bechenne/trampoline-labs/}. Inside there are 2 files: \unixcl{servos.h} and \unixcl{servo.cpp}.

%%Update Trampoline by going to the trampoline directory and typing \unixcl{git pull}. Compile goil.

%%\section{How servos work}

%%Servos are driven by using a PWM signal. The width of the signal at the high logic state specifies the position of the servo. The width may range from 0.5ms to 2.5ms for a 180° rotation. In practice servos may not be able to turn by 180° and we are going to use a pulse width ranging from 1ms to 2ms. The signal should repeat every 20ms.

%%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{servopwm.pdf}

%%\section{Servo PWM generation}

%%The board has 2 connectors for servos on the right side just below the LCD. Servos must be connected with the {\bf yellow wire nearby you} as shown on the picture below.

%%\begin{center}
   %%\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{servoconnection.jpg}
%%\end{center}

%%The 3.3V regulator of the Teensy is not able to power the servos. We need an external power supply connected to the bigs female banana plugs on the top of the board. Get 2 banana cords and connect them to the power supply and to the board as shown on the picture below.

%%\begin{center}
   %%\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{powersupply.jpg}
%%\end{center}



%%We are going to drive 2 servo. Each servo is driven by a task : \texttt{t_servo0} and \texttt{t_servo1}.

%%\begin{ex}
%%Program tasks \texttt{t_servo0} and \texttt{t_servo1}. Both tasks are periodic with a 20ms period but are offset by half of the period. \texttt{t_servo0} toggles LED L0-3 and \texttt{t_servo1} toggles LED L1-4. Verify the period using the scope. On the left there is a connector where LED signals are available as well as the GND. Use this connector to connect the scope probes. This connector is shown below
%%\end{ex}

%%\begin{center}
   %%\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{connecteurgauche.jpg}
%%\end{center}



%%Now instead of toggling the LED, each task will use the function \texttt{pulse}. This function takes 2 arguments. The first one is the \texttt{output}, the second one is the \texttt{duration} of the pulse in $\mu$s.  \texttt{pulse} does not allow values lower than 1000 and greater than 2000 in order to avoid to damage the servo. \texttt{pulse} works as follow: the \texttt{ouput} is set to 1 and a timer of the microcontroller is programmed to generate an interrupt after \texttt{duration} $\mu$s. Since the same timer is used for both tasks, the tasks have to be shifted by at least the maximum duration of the pulse. In your OIL file, you have to declare the ISR which is located in the \texttt{servo.c} file as follow:

%%\begin{lstlisting}
  %%ISR ftm_timer {
    %%CATEGORY = 1;
    %%PRIORITY = 1;
    %%SOURCE = FTM0_IRQ;
  %%};
%%\end{lstlisting}

%%You have to add the \texttt{servo.c} file in the sources of the application  and the fact you use the ftm library in the BUILD attribute of the OS object:

%%\begin{lstlisting}
      %%APP_SRC = "servo.c";
      %%LIBRARY = ftm;
%%\end{lstlisting}

%%\begin{ex}
%%Modify \texttt{t_servo0} and \texttt{t_servo1} to use \texttt{pulse} and generate a pulse with a width  equal to 1.5ms. Verify the behavior using the scope.
%%\end{ex}

%%Then change the pins from 3 and 4 to 20 and 21. 20 and 21 correspond to the servo connectors on the right. Connect the servos to the connectors Each servo should go to the average position. Do not forget to program pins 20 an 21 as \texttt{OUTPUT}.

%%\section{Adding high level behavior}

%%Now we want to set the position of each servo. To do that we need 2 tasks, 1 for each servo, that set the position in a global variable, 1 for each servo. The corresponding variable is read by the \texttt{t_servoX} task to drive the servo.

%%\begin{ex}
%%First we want the position of each servo incremented until it reaches its maximum position (2ms pulse), then decremented until it reaches its minimum position (1ms pulse). So the servo does round trips. The time we want to go from the minimum position to the maximum position is 5s. Assuming the position is incremented and decremented by one, what is the period of theses tasks in counter tick unit ?
%%\end{ex}

%%Now we want to be able to set the minimum and maximum positions of the servo connected to pin 20. To do that we use buttons.

%%\begin{ex}
%%Add to the previous application the following features and draw an automaton to model the application:

%%When button P0-8 is pressed, servo connected to pin 20 stops its round-trip. If it is pressed again, round-trip continue. When the round-trip is stopped the following functions are available.

%%When button P4-12 is pressed, the minimum position is selected, servo connected to pin 20 goes to this position. Then push buttons P2-10 decrements the minimum position and P1-9 increments the minimum position.

%%When button P3-11 is pressed, the maximum position is selected, servo connected to pin 20 goes to this position. Then push buttons P2-10 decrements the minimum position and P1-9 increments the minimum position.

%%Minimum position should be kept greater or equal than the position corresponding to the 1ms pulse. Maximum position should be kept lower or equal than the position corresponding to the 2ms pulse. Minimum position should be kept lower or equal than the maximum position.

%%When button P0-8 is pressed, servo connected to pin 20 continues its round-trip and respects the minimum and maximum positions that have been set.
%%\end{ex}
